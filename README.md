Time for a product review that can help us Arduinites

I've so far resisted the various offers of reviewing products (in exchange for a free sample of said product) but during my vacation three turned up that I thought might merit our attention.

The three products are ones that Arduinites might well be tempted to investigate (and, indeed, purchase) and I'm one of them! Even the rather specialised Espressif Wrover could easily find a (niche) use in a more sophisticated project, rather than using a standard Arduino Uno or Mega.

So whilst this might be considered a form of promotional video it is not really meant to be that - after all, I just a get a free shield but have to invest many hours doing a video! I just like to promote small businesses that seem to be head and shoulders above the rest (in the case of this week's video - no spoilers) and that deserve a bit of free publicity to enable them to succeed.

All the necessary links are here in my Github repository, together with the tiny sketch I used to flash those LEDs in sequence (which might interest newcomer Arduinites in the use of an array, for example).
